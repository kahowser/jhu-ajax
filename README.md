## Welcome to Kathryn's GitHub Page

This spring I am taking EN.605.787 Rich Internet Applications taught by [Yaakov Chaikin](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/yaakov-chaikin) through the [JHU EP Program](https://ep.jhu.edu/). As part of this course, we are taking two of Yaakov's Coursera courses: [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/welcome) and [Single Page Web Applications with AngularJS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-page-web-apps-with-angularjs/home/welcome).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kahowser/jhu-ajax/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kahowser/jhu-ajax/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
